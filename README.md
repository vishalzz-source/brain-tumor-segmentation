## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to automate the segmentation of brain tumors using MRI images. By leveraging deep learning models, especially CNNs, the system can identify abnormal growths in the brain, assisting radiologists in diagnosis and analysis.

## Dataset

This project works with the *BraTS* dataset (Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge), which includes multimodal MRI scans and ground truth segmentation masks.

- Dataset Link: [BraTS Dataset](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/data.html)
- Data modalities used: T1, T2, T1CE, and FLAIR

> *Note:* Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository.
